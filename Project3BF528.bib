	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Fast and accurate quality control is essential for studies involving next-generation sequencing data. Whilst numerous tools exist to quantify QC metrics, there is no common approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample sets. Assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early stages of analysis.
RESULTS: We present MultiQC, a tool to create a single report visualising output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified. MultiQC can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MultiQC is available with an GNU GPLv3 license on GitHub, the Python Package Index and Bioconda. Documentation and example reports are available at http://multiqc.info

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data., Results: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested., Availability and implementation: Trimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3.

	abstract = {RUNX1 is a transcription factor functioning both as an oncogene and a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. RUNX1 alters chromatin structure in cooperation with chromatin modifier and remodeling enzymes. In this study, we examined the relationship between RUNX1-mediated transcription and genome organization. We characterized genome-wide RUNX1 localization and performed RNA-seq and Hi-C in RUNX1-depleted and control MCF-7 breast cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis showed that RUNX1 depletion led to up-regulation of genes associated with chromatin structure and down-regulation of genes related to extracellular matrix biology, as well as NEAT1 and MALAT1 lncRNAs. Our ChIP-Seq analysis supports a prominent role for RUNX1 in transcriptional activation. 30\% of all RUNX1 binding sites were intergenic, indicating diverse roles in promoter and enhancer regulation and suggesting additional functions for RUNX1. Hi-C analysis of RUNX1-depleted cells demonstrated that overall three-dimensional genome organization is largely intact, but indicated enhanced association of RUNX1 near Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) boundaries and alterations in long-range interactions. This suggests an architectural role for RUNX1 in fine-tuning local interactions rather than in global organization. Our results provide novel insight into RUNX1-mediated perturbations of higher-order genome organization that are functionally linked with RUNX1-dependent compromised gene expression in breast cancer cells.},

This last year's updates include over 25 new annotation tracks such as the gnomAD 4.1 track on the human GRCh38/hg38 assembly, the addition of three new public hubs, and significant expansions to the Genome Archive[GenArk) system for interacting with the enormous variety of assemblies. We have also made improvements to our interface, including updates to the browser graphic page, such as a new popup dialog feature that now displays item details without requiring navigation away from the main Genome Browser page. GenePred tracks have been upgraded with right-click options for zooming and precise navigation, along with enhanced mouseOver functions.
